Note! Make sure that specified log file directories exist.

You can create host lists for each GUI by editing the *.hosts files. First
entry on the list is default on startup.

If you like to run multiple instances of servers in one computer, just
extract binaries to one directory and make symbolic links to subdirectories.
Then create .cfg files to those subdirectories and start processes.

If you like to change the font in saved .tif files, just copy another 
TrueType .ttf font file over fbfont.ttf.
